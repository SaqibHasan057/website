        <p class="lead">Hi!! My name is Mohammad(Md.) Saqib Hasan. I graduated with a bachelors in computer science and engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I am currently working as a research assistant under Professor Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Adnan in his "Applied Machine Learning" lab in BUET while pursuing my Masters from BUET.</p>

        <p class="lead">My field of research involves machine learning and application, mainly in the fields of deep learning or neural network. As part of undergraduate research, I worked on correlating our current statistical neural models with the human brain in order to develop faster and better models. During my time as research assistant, I worked in developing models for distributed deep learning through feature extraction, compression methods for deep neural networks and development of fake news detection through natural language processing. More details about my research is <a href="#about">here</a></p>

        <p class="lead">When I am not busy in the lab running simulations or brainstorming new research ideas, I am either enjoying a cup of hot tea by the local teashop while going through the latest gossips in the realm of politics, philosophy and history. Otherwise, I am on my home computer mashing through some new video game or planning my next trip to unknown lands and cultures. </p>

            In this work, we perform two research tasks concerned with the weights of neural networks. First, we develop three novel weight initialization algorithms inspired from the neuro-scientific construction of the brain of mammals and then test them on benchmark datasets to assess the performance of these algorithms. We call them lognormal weight initialization, modified lognormal weight initialization and skewed weight initialization. Secondly, we analyze the influence of training an artificial neural network on its weight distribution using skewness, kurtosis and linear regression for different weight initializations. Our analysis provides further insight into understanding the inner mechanism of neural networks.

            Deep learning has become the go-to method for solving a number of hard and complex problems. However, one constraint regarding the use of deep learning is that the size of the models is too large for storage on small devices and transmitting across the web. Hence, in this work we present a novel solution on compressing large neural network models for storage on small, embedded devices and the internet. Our algorithms utilize the power of the dimensionality reduction algorithm, Principle Component Analysis, to decompose the network parameters into smaller matrices for storage and distribution. When required, the compressed data can easily be decompressed into the parameters by our algorithms for inference/usage.

        <strong><h3>Geo-distributed Deep Learning Using Feature Extraction on Big Data</h3></strong>

            Digital data have been growing at an exponential rate in the past couple of years, mainly due to the wide availability and use of internet and social media. This "Big Data" is stored in various data centers across the globe. Such type of Big Data has now come to be exclusively known as Geo-distributed Data. Geo-distributed data have two constraints: the data are too big and it is too expensive, in terms of bandwidth, to bring all the data to a single node/data center; regional laws and data privacy measures prevent data from being easily moved out of their respective data centers. These constraints have generated a whole new set of machine learning problems directed towards geo-distributed data, collectively known as Geo-distributed Data Analytics. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning system for geo-distributed data based on feature extraction. The system is divided into two abstraction layers: local application layer and global application layer. The local layer uses neural network to extract features from data present in its own node.These features are extracted by local neural networks of each node and sent to the global layer at the central node. At the central node, another neural network train on these feature vector. In this way, the global model combines the local models. Our system also helps preserve privacy since it is difficult to recreate original data from extracted features which are transmitted through the network.

            The circulation of fake news has increased exponentially in recent years, especially with the advent of social media and automated messaging systems. Spikes in propagation was recently seen during and after the US 2016 elections, where people and bots from both spectrum of the political sphere were engaged in spreading of false and unverified information. With information propagating so fast on the internet, it is impossible to verify and corroborate every piece of information without clogging up the information highway. Hence, there has been a surge recently among researchers for automated, accurate and fast ways to detect fake news on the internet. In this research, we work towards creating a novel neural network architecture for optimal classification of fake news.
